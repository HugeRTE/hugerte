# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At HugeRTE, we take security seriously and will try to investigate all potential security risk notifications. However, as we're volunteers, please notice that we may not be as quick to respond to and fix them as you may expect.

To report a potential security vulnerability, contact the organization owner at <security-report@hugerte.org>.

HugeRTE requests community members reporting potential security vulnerabilities maintain the confidentiality of their report and discovery until we have investigated the issue and taken action to fix it.

HugeRTE will communicate with you regarding the status of your report and will, with your permission, publicly attribute the security issueâ€™s discovery to you after the issue has been fixed and disclosed.
